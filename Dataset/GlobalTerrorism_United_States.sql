The total amount of damages for the four bombings was around $45,000.  Three of the bombings took place within ten minutes of each other beginning at 6:00 AM (197510130003, 197510130005, and 197510130006).  David Hill, Leonard Crow Dog, and Anna Mae Aquash, members of the American Indian Movement, were suspected of crafting and placing the dynamite bomb at the substation.

In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called Otpor, or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States.

The Justice Department also committed a razor blade campaign in August 1999 against the fur industry. Though most sources state that 80 letters were sent out, the group claimed it was over 80 letters, and some sources note as many as 87 letters.','Six UW researchers receive booby-trapped letters, Associated Press State & Local Wire, October 28, 1999.','Alexis Chiu, Animal rights extremists suspected of targeting scientists across U.S., Associated Press State & Local Wire, October 28, 1999.','Animal Rights Group Mails Razor Blades To Medical Researchers, Says Foundation for Biomedical Research; Group Warns of Wave of Violence If Primate Research Is Not Halted, PR Newswire, October 25, 1999.','Eco Project 2010',0,1,0,1),(200000000000,1999,11,1,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','Washington','Seattle',47.610786,-122.331306,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,7,'Facility/Infrastructure Attack',1,'Business',7,'Retail/Grocery/Bakery','Gap','Gap clothing store in Seattle, WA',217,'United States',NULL,'Animal Liberation Front (ALF)',1,0,8,'Incendiary',20,'Gasoline or Alcohol','incendiaries',0,'0','0',0,'0','0',1,3,'Minor (likely < $1 million)','-99','little damage',0,0,NULL,'FBI, Terrorism in the United States: 1999, Counterterrosism Threat Assessment and Warning Unit, Counterterrorism Division, FBI, DOJ, 1999.','Wave Of Eco-Terrorism Mocks Ideal Of Free Speech, Tampa Tribune, July 18, 2003.',NULL,'Eco Project 2010',0,1,0,1),(200000000000,1999,12,25,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','Oregon','Monmouth',44.846329,-123.229326,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,7,'Facility/Infrastructure Attack',1,'Business',NULL,NULL,'Boise Cascade','wood products company in Monmouth, OR',217,'United States',NULL,'Earth Liberation Front (ELF)',0,0,8,'Incendiary',20,'Gasoline or Alcohol','buckets of fuel, placed in black garbage bags and then in large boxes wrapped in Christmas paper to further conceal them',0,'0','0',0,'0','0',1,2,'Major (likely >= $1 million but < $1 billion)','1689593','building destroyed',0,0,'Incident occurred between 1:00am and 4:00am.

Sands still maintained that he was against development of preserved areas, but also that he knew how to sell it, knew what a god media story was, and there was a sense of power behind the string of incidents that the media fed on.

However, during the Federal Grand Jury indictment, prosecutors maintained that Sands committed the acts for his own twisted reasons and the he fabricated letters and claims from the CSP to carry out his plot.  Sands still maintained that he was against development of preserved areas, but also that he knew how to sell it, knew what a god media story was, and there was a sense of power behind the string of incidents that the media fed on.  The true motives appear to be a combination of personal reasons and to make a broader environmental message, but they remain unknown.  The FBI investigation determined that Sands did in fact fabricate the CSP. The victims of the incidents were fearful or recurring arsons, and according to sources, Sands still  terrorized the community to portray a broader message.','Trail cold in Catalina Foothills arsons, Associated Press State & Local Wire, June 12, 2002.','Ignition device found in one of four Tucson arsons, Associated Press State & Local Wire, June 17, 2001.','Ecoterrorism: Radical Group Linked to Arizona Fires, Greenwire, June 13, 2001.','Eco Project 2010',0,0,0,0),(200000000000,2001,7,12,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','Washington','Arlington',48.194295,-122.126414,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,7,'Facility/Infrastructure Attack',1,'Business',12,'Construction','construction site','equipment at the construction site of new high school in Arlington, WA',217,'United States',NULL,'Unknown',0,0,8,'Incendiary',18,'Arson/Fire',NULL,0,'0','0',0,'0','0',1,3,'Minor (likely < $1 million)','250000','backhoe loader destroyed',0,0,NULL,'Police searching for vandals, Associated Press State & Local Wire, July 14, 2001.',NULL,NULL,'Eco Project 2010',-9,-9,0,-9),(200000000000,2001,7,24,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','Nevada','Stateline',38.962408,-119.939903,3,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,7,'Facility/Infrastructure Attack',1,'Business',8,'Hotel/Resort','Heavenly Valley Ski Resort','gondola transportation system at Heavenly Valley Ski Resort in Stateline, NV',217,'United States',NULL,'Earth Liberation Front (ELF)',1,0,11,'Sabotage Equipment',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'0','0',0,'0','0',1,3,'Minor (likely < $1 million)','2000',NULL,0,0,NULL,'FBI, Terrorism 2000/2001,FBI, DOJ, 2001.',NULL,NULL,'Eco Project 2010',0,1,0,1),(200000000000,2001,8,8,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','Puerto Rico','Vieques',18.14859,-65.442114,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,'Bombing/Explosion',4,'Military',34,'Military Personnel (soldiers, troops, officers, forces)','United States Navy','Two United States Navy sailors in Vieques, Puerto Rico',217,'United States',NULL,'Unknown',0,0,8,'Incendiary',19,'Molotov Cocktail/Petrol Bomb','The perpetrators threw Molotov Cocktails at the sailors.',0,'0','0',0,'0','0',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,'World Briefs, St. Louis Post Dispatch (Missouri), August 9, 2001.',NULL,NULL,'CETIS',-9,-9,0,-9),(200000000000,2001,9,8,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','Arizona','Tucson',32.222232,-110.925752,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,7,'Facility/Infrastructure Attack',1,'Business',2,'Restaurant/Bar/Cafe','McDonalds Corporation','A McDonalds restaurant in Tucson, Arizona',217,'United States',NULL,'Animal Liberation Front (ALF)',0,0,8,'Incendiary',18,'Arson/Fire',NULL,0,'0','0',0,'0','0',1,3,'Minor (likely < $1 million)','500000',NULL,0,NULL,NULL,'Restaurant arson work of eco-terrorists?, The Associated Press, September 11, 2001.','Alleged anonymous activists claim restaurant arson, The Associated Press, September 12, 2001.',NULL,'CETIS',0,1,0,1),(200000000000,2001,9,11,0,217,'United States',1,'North America','New York','New York City',40.697132,-73.931351,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,4,'Hijacking',14,'Private Citizens & Property',67,'Unnamed Civilian/Unspecified','Civilians','Passengers and crew members on American Airlines Flight 11 and the people working in the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City',217,'United States','1','Al-Qaida',0,0,10,'Vehicle (not to include vehicle-borne explosives, i.e., car or truck bombs)',NULL,NULL,'The attackers reportedly gained control of the plane using sharp objects resembling knives or other sharpened metal objects.
